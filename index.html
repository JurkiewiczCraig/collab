<h2> Understanding Neighbourhood Walkability in Peterborough, Ontario
</h2>
<div class = "proposal">
<h3>Project Abstract</h3>

<p>
    The City of Peterboroughâ€™s Transportation Master Plan includes a goal of increasing mode shares for active and public transportation in the municipality to 25% and 10% respectively. To aid in reaching this goal, STAC Enterprises has been asked to produce a series of deliverables which will assist City staff in understanding the present state of walkability in Peterborough. A list of weighted walkability factors will be produced using multi-criteria decision analysis, then  the relevant data needed for walkability analysis will be collected, organized, and formatted. A series of spatial analyses will then be conducted with the goal of producing classified suitability surfaces indicating where certain factors are present and absent, eventually leading to the production of an overall walkability index. The results of the analysis will be presented to the client in the form of a file geodatabase containing all relevant layers and data and a dashboard that allows walkability factors to be easily observed. They will also receive a StoryMap explaining how the index works along with static cartographic outputs (such as heat maps) showing the various factors and final results.

<h3> Study Area</h3>
<p>The study area for this project will consist of everything within the limits of the City of Peterborough. The City of Peterborough had a population of 83,651 people as of 2021, which is an increase of 3.2% over its 2016 population. It contains just over 38,000 private dwellings stretching across a land area of 64.76 square kilometers, with an overall population density of 1291.8 people per square kilometer. Peterborough is home to the Otonabee River, which splits the city in two, with the majority of development being located on the west side. Peterborough is home to two major educational institutions: Trent University, which is located on the northern fringe of the city, and Fleming College, which is located to the far southwest.</p>

	<h3> Objectives and deliverables</h3>
	<p>The City of Peterborough has outlined a master plan through their transportation department to help make the city more pedestrian friendly while decreasing overall automobile use. The first step in this project involves gaining an understanding of walkability within the city through analysis of which factors influence people's walking behaviors. At the moment, there is no way for city staff to effectively view the stats on local walkability or the factors that go into influencing how walkable certain areas are compared to others. The goal of this project is to aid city staff and officials in getting a better understanding of walkability in the city to aid in city planning and better implement their TMP. In this project, we will have several deliverables for our client, including an ArcGIS Dashboard, cartographic outputs and an Esri file Geodatabase for the clients to go over and use for any potential future projects.
