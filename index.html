<h2> Understanding Neighbourhood Walkability in Peterborough, Ontario
</h2>

<h3>Project Abstract</h3>

<p>
	The City of Peterborough’s Transportation Master Plan (TMP) is intended to reduce automobile mode share to 65% while increasing public transportation and active transportation up to 10 and 25% respectively.  To achieve these goals, the city wishes to create an index to determine which of its dissemination areas (DAs) are considered more pedestrian-friendly than others. The goal of this project was to create a walkability index for Peterborough using geographic information system (GIS) techniques. As well, the results were to be displayed in a variety of web apps that make the information easier to understand and aid policy makers and city staff in their decision making. An Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach (in consideration with the clients goals) was used to weight several factors centered around safety, accessibility, and comfort, with safety being given priority weighting, then accessibility and then factors associated with comfort. A walkability index was created in ArcGIS Pro, primarily by summarizing various sub-factors into dissemination areas and then generating ratios to produce a final factor.  Through the use of ArcGIS Dashboards, the walkability index, the component factors, and several important attributes related to transportation and population size were displayed in an engaging and simple to use fashion. Using an ArcGIS StoryMap, the team was able to go into more detail about the creation of the layers and factors chosen for this walkability index.  Finally, a survey using Survey123 was created to help collect more spatial data for integration into future versions of the walkability index and display it in the Dashboard. Based on the results of the walkability index, it was found that the City of Peterborough’s most walkable areas are located near its downtown core, with the least walkable areas being located on the urban fringe.  This walkability index is just the first version of many indexes to come and it is intended to evolve over time with the needs of the city.</p>

    <img src = "images/logo.png"alt = "Peterborough Logo"  class = "center" >
</a>
<p>The client for this project is the City of Peterborough, with the project contacts being Lindsay Stroud (lstroud@peterborough.ca), Transportation Demand Management Planner, and Andrew Nichols (anichols@peterborough.ca), GIS Technologist.</p>

<h3> Study Area</h3>
<p>The study area for this project will consist of everything within the limits of the City of Peterborough. The City of Peterborough had a population of 83,651 people as of 2021, which is an increase of 3.2% over its 2016 population. It contains just over 38,000 private dwellings stretching across a land area of 64.76 square kilometers, with an overall population density of 1291.8 people per square kilometer. Peterborough is home to the Otonabee River, which splits the city in two, with the majority of development being located on the west side. Peterborough is home to two major educational institutions: Trent University, which is located on the northern fringe of the city, and Fleming College, which is located to the far southwest.</p>

	<h3> Objectives and deliverables</h3>
	<p>The overall goal for this project was to create a walkability index for the City of Peterborough, as this would help them with their TMP and city planning going forward.  Creating a Walkability Index would have far reaching impacts for the city as it would allow them to make better decisions on housing, local infrastructure and public services.  This GIS approach to creating a walkability index also allows for the use of web based applications to further aid the client in decision making processes as well as gathering data on certain structures and presenting on how the data was collected and analyzed.  These objectives included:
	</p>
	<ol type = "1">
<li>Create a Walkability Index for the City of Peterborough based on factors discussed by the client and the team at STAC Enterprises.</li>
<li>Create and develop an ArcGIS Dashboard, Storymap and Survey 123 for the client to showcase, explain and collect the data in an interactive and informative manner that the client can use in future city plans. </li>
	
<li>Create static cartographic outputs that explain Peterborough’s walkability index in a visually pleasing manner using a choropleth map, along with several other static maps that go more into detail with other factors that relate to Peterborough's walkability.
</li>
<li>Create an Esri File Geodatabase complete with all layers associated with the walkability index, along with a toolbox with models for the client to see how each of the factors were calculated, measured and weighed against each other to create a walkability index.</li></ol>
