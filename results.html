<h2>StaticMaps</h2>
    <p>For Static maps, we have created induvidual maps for every factors considered and the final walkability index too. Apart from it, we have created a mapbook with a few layers overlayed on the final walkability index to have a better understanding of the walkability with the context to it's neighbourhood. </p>
<h4>Induvidual Maps</h4>
<p>Each factor is mapped with it's final ratio with the relavant layer overlayed to give a better understanding of the output. These maps have the formula used in raster calculator to give the context on how it was processed, with it's share of weight in the final index. In terms of the final walkability map, each factor with its share of weights for the index is given to explain how it was arrived. Added to it, some infographics with the census data make it more informative and gives a better understanding about the walkability.</p>

<h4>Mapbook</h4>	    
<p>With all the factors discussed, we wanted to overlay few layers over the final walkability index map to get a better understanding with respect to the neighbourhood. This mapbook splits the city of Peterbourough into 52 parts in grids and displaying all the features in detail.</p>

<h2>Dashboard</h2>
<p>The ArcGIS Dashboard contains several elements that change with the current map extent, along with the user clicks on DA's.

<h2> Survey123</h2>
<p>Through the use of Survey123, city workers will be able to document, track and comment on structures associated with walkability for data to be used in future analysis, such as sidewalk quality, bark bench counts and accessibility for garbage and recycling cans.
